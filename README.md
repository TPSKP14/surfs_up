Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (20 points)
Deliverable 3 Instructions
For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.
The analysis should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

Background
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

It is clear that we have sufficient data to support our findings from both exercises.  
June seems to be an ideal month for our surf and ice cream shop
December slightly less ideal 
But there is minimal varience between the two months.  
Oahu looks to be the perfect place for W. Avy's project

We should look at ideal beaches in Oahu for surfing.  The North Shore is historically the best 7 miles of beach for surfing in the entire world, and as thus is nicknamed the 7 mile miracle.  Winter is typically the best time of year to surf in the north shore.  We should compare the average wave heights during the winter with the weather during that time frame.  We should do the same for beaches on the south shore, and if possible get statistics on the populations disbursement throughout the island
